# Project Name: Lab 07 - NodeJS NPM Express

**Author**: Tim McCoy and Earl Jay Caoile
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This program is hosted on a node server. It takes articles from a file that is either on a local database or user storage if the user has previous visited the page. It then lists the articles on the index page. On the new page, a user can create a new article to submit. That article is then saved as an object to be submitted to the back end.

## Getting Started
A user must download all of the files from our Github repository. NodeJS must also be installed and properly configured. In order to get the server running, a user must type out "node server.js".

## Architecture
This program uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Libraries include jQuery, Marked, Highlight, and Handlebars.
